# Train Station

### Demo application based on Apache Pulsar
The purpose of this application is to show how to build a simple event-driven application on top of Apache Pulsar. 
This application is written in functional Scala with Tagless Final style and ZIO Task is used as the main effect.
Also, I've used [Tofu toolkit](https://github.com/tofu-tf/tofu) to improve Tagless Final code.
You can find detailed description of the app in the blog post - https://scala.monster/train-station-tofu/

#### Testing
In order to run unit tests:
```sbt
sbt test
```

#### Running
This repository contains a `docker-compose` file, which includes 4 services: 
* Apache Pulsar
* Zurich train station
* Bern train station
* Geneva train station

First, build a docker image of the service by running command:
```sbt
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

When you have successfully built docker images you can start environment: 
```sbt
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start all the services in the background. All train stations will connect to Apache Pulsar. 
Services are starting much faster than Apache Pulsar so they will retry until it is ready.   
A train station service is ready when you see a similar log message:
```
[2020-09-30T19:10:52.064Z] Started train station Bern
```

#### Calling service endpoints
To test if services are working correctly you can send a `Departure` request:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8082/departure \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"id": "123",
	"to": "Bern",
	"time": "2020-12-03T10:15:30.00Z",
	"actual": "2020-12-03T10:15:30.00Z"
}'
```
This will create a departing train from Zurich to Bern. 
In order to mark train as arrived send another HTTP request: 
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8081/arrival \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"trainId": "123",
	"time": "2020-12-03T10:15:30.00Z"
}'
```
